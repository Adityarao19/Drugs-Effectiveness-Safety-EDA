# 💊 Drug Effectiveness & Safety Explorer – Data Science EDA Project

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of drug-related information obtained from Drugs.com. The primary objective is to understand the relationships between drug effectiveness, side effects, safety categories, and user reviews. Using powerful data science tools, this analysis delivers insights into how various drugs perform and how patients experience them.

## 🔍 Insights & Findings

- **Pain** is the most commonly treated condition across all drugs.
- **Hives, itching, and breathing difficulties** are among the top side effects.
- **CSA Schedule 2** drugs tend to have lower user ratings, indicating higher risk perception.
- **OTC drugs** generally receive better ratings compared to prescription-only drugs.
- Drugs with **alcohol interaction warnings** receive more cautious or lower ratings.

These insights can support both **medical researchers** and **data scientists** working in healthtech analytics.
